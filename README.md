## Lambda Expression
 * Comparison between Anonymous class and Lambda expression 
 * Lambdas implement a functional interface. 
 * Anonymous Inner Classes can extend a class or implement an interface with any number of methods. 
 * Variables – Lambdas can only access final or effectively final. 
 * State – Anonymous inner classes can use instance variables and thus can have state, lambdas cannot. 
 * Scope – Lambdas can't define a variable with the same name as a variable in enclosing scope.
 * Compilation – Anonymous compiles to a class, while lambda is an invokedynamic instruction.
